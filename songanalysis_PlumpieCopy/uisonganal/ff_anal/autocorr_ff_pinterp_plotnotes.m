function autocorr_ff_pinterp_plotnotes(RawDataDir, batch_in,note, ff_low, ff_hi,FileType, PlotOption) % feature added by Raghav as an argument

%function autocorr_ff_pinterp pulls out all examples of the sound defined by string 'note' 
%uses a batch file ('batch_in') of notefiles and calculates the ff of a 16ms segment of the
%syllable, which is determined by the user
%the user enters the start of the segment by entering either the ms_from_start of the syllable
%or the % in the syllable

%this function uses parts of pick_notes and get_songs to pull out the relevant 16ms segment of the
%syllable of interest, calculates the auto-covariance of the segment, and then
%looks for the distance, in frequency, between the 0th lag and the first peak (does parabolic
%interpolation of the peak given three points)

%us assumes that the file type is 'filt' b/c it requires that notes are already labeled 
%using uisonganal

%also assumes that you are in the subdirectory w/ the data files and the .filt files
